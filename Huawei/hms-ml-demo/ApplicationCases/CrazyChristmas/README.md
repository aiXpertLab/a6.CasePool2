## Introduction
   CrazyChristmas uses the hand key point recognition function of HUAWEI ML Kit to control the sled to move to catch falling goods.
   
   Obtain the [DemoAPK](https://h5hosting-drcn.dbankcdn.cn/cch5/AIBussiness-MLKit/christmas/apk_release_christmas_game.apk) for experience.

   This demo demonstrates how to use [HUAWEI ML Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-mlkit) to quickly develop a red envelopes game app. The purpose is to      help you experience the hand key point function and integrate HUAWEI ML Kit as soon as possible.

## More Scenarios
With the hand key point recognition capability provided by HUAWEI ML Kit, you can not only develop CrazyChristmas applets, but also implement various functions, such as:
1. Add special effects to hands.
2. Hand action switching background.

## Procedure
- Preparations
  - Add the Huawei Maven repository to the build.gradle file in the root directory of the project.
  - Add build dependency on the SDK to the build.gradle file in the app directory.
  - Add the hand key point detection model to the manifest.xml file of Android.
  - Apply for the camera permission in the manifest.xml file of Android.

- Key steps of code development
  - Submit a dynamic permission application.
  - Create a hand keypoint analyzer.
  - Create a LensEngine.
  - Call the lensEngine.run(holder) method to perform hand keypoint recognition to move sled.

## Supported Environments
Devices with Android 4.4 or later are recommended.
